# The Package Manager

## What it is

A package manager is a program that lets you install another programs, in a easy and effective way.

Each distribution normally has it's own package manager, but that doesn't mean there aren't common
package managers among distributions.

The most common one, `apt` (Advanced Packaging Tool), also known as `apt-get`, is the one we're
going to focus on, as it's debian's package manager (the distribution Ubuntu derives from).
